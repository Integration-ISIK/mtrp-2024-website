              The programme consists of a written examination and a camp. The competition will be held in two categories, one for students studying in or below X (Junior Category) standard and the other for classes XI and XII (Senior Category). Moreover, this time the examination is being held in both online and offline mode in order to extend the availability of this unique experience to the students for whom it will be difficult to report to the designated centres for an offline examination.

              Students from each category are selected for the math camp based on their performance in the written test. The camp consists of interactive sessions with mathematicians, ISI faculties and scholars from other universities, along with a few exercises.

                  A written examination is held in various cities in India, specifically, Kolkata, Durgapur, Siliguri separately for the two categories. The corresponding papers consist of two sections. Section I has objective problems (MCQ and/or integer-type) and Section II has subjective problems. The applicants are given two and half hours to solve the paper. Based on their composite scores in the objective and subjective sections, students securing marks above a certain cut-off qualify for the MTRP Camp. The cut-offs are not predetermined and are separate for the Junior and the Senior Category students as well as for the online and offline candidates. The list of selected candidates will be uploaded in the MTRP website and the candidates will also be individually informed.
